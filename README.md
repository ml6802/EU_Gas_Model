# EU_Gas_Model
Development Repo for EU Gas Model out of ZERO Lab

The purpose of this model is to provide a test-bed for various policy environments as a resource to EU energy security, as well as to highlight bottlenecks in the current system.

# Installation
Download the core .jl model file, and the corresponding inputs folder. Update the folder address for a folder containing both the "Inputs" folder and an "Outputs" folder of your own creation.

The current version uses CPLEX, but use the optimizer of your choice.
